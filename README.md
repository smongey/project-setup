# Setup Yall

My project setup compiling compass and coffeescript through guard.
Don’t forget livereload for a birra code injection.

Don’t forget to 

	gem install bootstrap-sass guard guard-coffeescript guard-sass guard-compass guard-livereload guard-concat


Using Terminal (ooooo, scary) cd into this folder after you cloned it and just run ‘guard’ :)
